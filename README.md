# Rust-Chain

Welcome to the development of a decentralized **blockchain system**, built entirely from scratch using **Rust**. This project aims to create a secure and efficient ledger where blocks of data are linked together using **cryptographic hashing**, ensuring the chain's integrity and immutability over time.

By integrating a reliable **consensus algorithm**, we will establish a mechanism for achieving agreement among all participants in the network, maintaining trust and decentralization. With Rustâ€™s focus on **performance** and **memory safety**, the project is designed to offer a fast, secure, and scalable foundation for decentralized applications.

The goal is to develop an elegant and robust system that captures the essential principles of blockchain technology while leveraging the power of Rust for building a reliable and future-proof infrastructure.
