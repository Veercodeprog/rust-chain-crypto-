# Rust-Chain

Welcome to the development of a decentralized **blockchain system**, built entirely from scratch using **Rust**. This project aims to create a secure and efficient ledger where blocks of data are linked together using **cryptographic hashing**, ensuring the chain's integrity and immutability over time.

By integrating a reliable **consensus algorithm**, we will establish a mechanism for achieving agreement among all participants in the network, maintaining trust and decentralization. With Rustâ€™s focus on **performance** and **memory safety**, the project is designed to offer a fast, secure, and scalable foundation for decentralized applications.

The goal is to develop an elegant and robust system that captures the essential principles of blockchain technology while leveraging the power of Rust for building a reliable and future-proof infrastructure.

### What is a Blockchain?

To understand blockchains, we first need to discuss distributed ledgers. You've likely heard this term mentioned alongside blockchain, as the two are closely related.

You might have encountered the peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol, **BitTorrent**. This protocol allows file-sharing in a decentralized way. Typically, when downloading a file from the internet, you send a request to a specific server that stores the entire file and transfers it to your device. This is known as **client-server architecture**.

BitTorrent, however, distributes a single file across multiple peers simultaneously. When downloading a file from the **Torrent network**, you're actually pulling pieces from multiple sources. Over time, you become a source yourself by participating in the network, sharing the file with others.
